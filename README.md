# Metaheuristic TA tunning with Google Trends

This project replicates what was done in https://github.com/RamonHA/Metaheuristics-TA-Tunning .

With the integration of sentiment analysis extracted from GoogleTrends, we search to see an increase in performance for our stock return prediction model.

We will study the relevance of these new features and new Macroeconomic Variables (MEV) features into our model.

Other TA technics are considered with a different (shorter) search range.

## Requierements
Installation and configuration of "trading" python package (https://github.com/RamonHA/trading).
